**Topic: Data Pipelining and Visualization**

In recent times , we have seen the introduction of a new concept 
called Industry 4.0 in which the emphasis lies on data driven decision 
making . The data is usually collected from customers or clients who 
use the services of the firm or various equipment used for production 
of goods for the firm. The accumulated data is then extracted and 
processed and visualized with different filters to aid in the decision 
making process.
### Here we designed a website for visualizing data , consisting of a progress bar displaying all the steps user has accomplished right from taking data from the source to displaying it on the website and sending notifications to the user. The user also have the options to apply different filters and provide mechanisms to apply statistical and analytical methods such as regression , so that the end user can derive useful insights from the provided raw data.
## **_MAIN FEATURES_**
**UPLOADING OF FILES** (WINDOW 1): The data to be used as input must strictly be in the form of .csv files. The user can click, select and upload the respective files.

**UPLOADING OF FILES TO DATABASE** (WINDOW 2) : Sends the uploaded files to MongoDB.The platform sends real-time notifications to the user on successful uploading of files.

**VISUALIZATION OF DATA** (WINDOW 3) : The user interface allows the user to plot the features in different graphs as per their own requirements .
                                       **  _The platform allows downloading the graphs and charts chosen by the user to the local PC._ **
                                        
**STATISTICAL/ANALYTICAL METHODS** (WINDOW 4) : The user interface allows the application of atleast a few statistical and analytical methods.
